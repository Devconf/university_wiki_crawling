The university grants bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees through its seven colleges: the College of Arts & Sciences, School of Business Administration, School of Education, School of Engineering & Applied Science, School of Law, School of Nursing & Human Physiology, and the School of Leadership Studies.

History
Founding
Gonzaga University was founded in 1887 by Italian-American Joseph Cataldo (1837â€“1928), who had come in 1865 as a Jesuit missionary to the Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest. In 1880, Cataldo built a schoolhouse about 10 to 12 mi (16 to 19 km) northeast of  Spokane on the Peone Prairie, to serve children of the Upper Spokane Indians. Cataldo was concerned about the influence and expansion of Protestant schools on the region's native people, and by 1881 was discussing building a Jesuit college with other Jesuit leaders.
The Jesuits chose a location at Spokane Falls (later Spokane) due to its centrality in the Washington, Idaho and Montana region. The Jesuits purchased 320 acres of prime real estate in the city's central business district north of the Spokane River for $936. The Northern Pacific Railway was holding the land in reserve, but Cataldo was able to convince railroad executive John W. Sprague to allow the sale to build the school.The City of Spokane offered to help pay to build the new college, on the condition that it be a whites only school, in spite of Cataldo's original purpose to educate the local native population. Cataldo's letters seeking the support of Church leadership in Rome warned that Methodists and other Protestants were building schools and that the city funding could go to them if the Catholic school was not built soon enough.

First class
Construction was delayed until 1886, and the school opened in 1887 with Father James Rebmann the school's first Father Superior and seven boys enrolled. They were taught by 17 faculty made up of Jesuit priests and Jesuits in training, scholastics. By the end of the year, more students enrolled, and two were expelled, ending the year with a student body of 18 boys, all white. Father Joseph Joset, a Jesuit missionary, attempted to enroll two native American boys but was rebuffed due to the whites-only policy. Father Rebmann told Joset that the school was only open to "Americans," which he did not consider Indians to be. Non-Catholic boys were also rejected, at least in the college's first years.The students who had been expelled might have run afoul of rules against offense like theft, disobedience, or impurity, and were forbidden to have alcohol or tobacco. The boys were supervised at all times, and not allowed off-campus without a chaperone present. They woke at 5:30 am, and worked continuously until the 8:30 pm lights out. Students attended Mass six days a week, and twice on Sundays, and faced often daunting advancement exams. The school was divided into a Preparatory section for elementary school-age boys, an Academic section with Third, Second, and First divisions, and an upper-division like a liberal arts college, for Poetry, Rhetoric and Philosophy. In the second year, enrollment began the year with 35 boys, 27 of whom still attended at years end. By 1890, 3 of the original 17 faculty remained. The original Father Superior was followed by Father Charles Mackin who was replaced in 1891 by Father John Baptist Rene. He served until 1893 and was replaced by Father Leopold Van Gorp.Students were not allowed to advance to higher forms except upon passage of rigorous examinations. Examinations were rigorous and overseen by the Prefect of Studies. The examinations were so difficult that students would sometimes become very ill from anxiety while preparing for them and some students withdrew rather than face them.In 1884, Gonzaga conferred its first Bachelor of Arts degrees, to two students. A four-story building was planned in 1897, and opened in 1899, as the New Gonzaga  In 1892, with an enrollment of 50 boys, football, called "college-down", was first played at Gonzaga on Thanksgiving Day. The same year Gonzaga added a new dormitory, and a wood-framed St. Aloysius Church, and the campus had electric power service for the first time.

Abusive priests sent to live on campus
In 2018, the Center for Investigative Reporting published evidence that the Cardinal Bea House, owned by the Jesuit order and located on Gonzaga's campus, was used by the Catholic Church as a retirement home for priests with histories of sexual predation and abuse from across the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, from the 1970s through 2016. Sexually abusive priests were quietly kept there and out of contact with vulnerable populations, while at the same time protecting the priests from any liability for the abuses they had committed. The last abusive priest moved out of the Cardinal Bea House in 2016.The Spokane Spokesman-Review newspaper questioned Gonzaga President Thayne McCulloh's statements that he did not know, before and during his time as president, about the abusive priests kept on campus.

Campus
Gonzaga's main campus has 105 buildings on 152 acres. The university has two large libraries. Foley Center Library is Gonzaga's main graduate and undergraduate library, opened in 1992. Chastek Law Library primarily serves the Gonzaga University School of Law, erected in 2000. The Rosauer School of Education building was completed in 1994.Gonzaga hosts many unique pieces of artwork, largely devoted to historical religious figures and prominent Catholics.

The Jundt Art Center and Museum established in 1995 also has a variety of artwork from differing periods. The spires of St. Aloysius Church are a landmark of the Spokane area.

Due to an expanding student body, Gonzaga completed construction of a $60 million building that serves as the new Circulus Omnium Gonzagaorum (COG) "center of campus," the John J. Hemmingson Center which replaced the former COG that students used for over 60 years. The three-story building with almost 4 acres (1.6 ha; 167,000 sq ft) of floor space has an all-glass exterior. It was completed in time for the Fall 2015 semester.In 2014, the university made plans to build a performing arts center named after benefactor Myrtle Woldson that would have a 750-seat theater.In addition to the campus in Spokane, Gonzaga's virtual campus has degree programs.
